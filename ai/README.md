# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

In this webinar we look at the cross cutting techniques that Cloudinary provides using AI.  We can use AI to better understand our images for the purpose of management, cropping, accessibility and control.

Gravity is an option that we provide in our transformations.  It's available without any extra configuration or authorization.  The rest of the AI feature are available as add-ons.  Some add-ons are based on Cloudinary services and some by services provided by AWS, Google, Azure, and WebPurify. 

- gravity (Cloudinary)
- background removal (Cloudinary)
- ai content analysis (Cloudinary)
- auto tagging (AWS and Google)
- video moderation (AWS and Google)
- advanced facial attribute detection (Azure)
- OCR detection and extraction (Google)
- video transcription (Azure and Google)

To get access to a Cloudinary Add-on, you need to go to the add-ons page.  Find an icon that looks like a puzzle piece and click on it to get to the Add-ons selection page.  Even as a free user you can try out any of the Add-ons.

We'll learn to use Cloudinary add-ons for some of these feature, and find that some feature can be handled using transformations.
