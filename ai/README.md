# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

In this webinar we look at the cross cutting techniques that Cloudinary provides using AI.  We can use AI to 

-  add tags to help with managing assets
-  analyze the objects in an image 
-  help with cropping an image or video to retain interesting elements of the asset
-  removing the background in an image
-  transcribing the audio in a video into text
-  detecting and extracting text in an image
-  moderating video to look for unwanted content like violence and pornography

We'll learn to use Cloudinary add-ons for some of these feature, and find that some feature can be handled using transformations.
