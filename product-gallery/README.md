# Using Cloudinary Product Gallery in a React-Based E-Commerce Application

Look at how to implement the Cloudinary Product Gallery Widget in your application. 

1. Vanilla JS  
2. Create React App  
3. Next.js TypeScript Application  

When working with React, we can create a `ProductGallery` component and pass parameters to include or modify features.  
In all cases, we need to render an element to the DOM and then apply 3rd party JavaScript to build out the DOM with widget features.
