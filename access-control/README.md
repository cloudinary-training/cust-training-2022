## Access Control
This code was used to prepare for the `Access Control and Security for Media with Cloudinary's APIs` training.

Cloudinary provides several way to restrict access to assets and/or transformations including `access_control`, `type`, and `strict transformations`.

If you have restricted your assets in any way, you can use URL signing, named transformations with allow_for_strict enabled, or eager, explicit transformations to help with delivery.

## Running the code

Run all script from the root directory because asset references are relative to root. See README in root for full instructions.



## DON'T FORGET TO DISABLE STRICT
