# Vercel Integration
Vercel provides the Next.js framework and the Next Image Component.  Cloudinary provides image and video components, a transformation library, an upload widget and a video player.

We use Next.js to statically generate web pages that host Image and Video Media.  We show techniques for uploading in both the frontend and backend.
